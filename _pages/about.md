#### about

I am currently an AI Engineer at [NetEase Games](https://www.neteasegames.com/). Prior to this, I completed my PhD degree in mechanical engineering at **UCLA** in January 2024, advised by Prof. **[Joseph Teran](https://math.ucdavis.edu/~jteran/)**. Before entering graduate school, I received my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2017.

#### research

While my background is in mechanical engineering (focusing on computational mechanics, to be more specific), my research focuses on **physics-based simulations** of various substances and phenomena in computer graphics, such as clothes, volumetric deformable solids, fluids, thermomechanical effects, etc.
