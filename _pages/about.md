#### about

I am currently working on physics simulations for humanoid robots at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/AI). 
Previously, I completed my PhD degree at **UCLA**, advised by Prof. **[Joseph Teran](https://math.ucdavis.edu/~jteran/)**.
I studied mechanical engineering with a focus on computational mechanics and computer graphics.
My research centers on numerical simulations of physical phenomena for computer graphics applications, including cloth, volumetric deformable solids, fluids, and thermomechanical effects.
