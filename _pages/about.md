#### About

I am a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at **UCLA** advised by Prof. **[Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. Before entering graduate school, I received my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2017.

#### Research

My research interests are in physics-based animations in computer graphics and computational mechanics, including various simulations of deformable solids, fluids, and thermomechanical effects.

Outside the campus, I did an internship at **[X](https://x.company)** in 2021, where I worked on implementing a new model in **[Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)** to accelerate the deformable object simulations.
