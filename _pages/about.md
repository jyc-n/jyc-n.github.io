#### about

I am a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at **UCLA** advised by Prof. **[Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/)**. Before entering graduate school, I received my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2017.

#### research

While my background is in mechanical engineering (focusing on computational mechanics, to be more specific), my research focuses on **physics-based animations** in computer graphics, including various simulations of clothes, volumetric deformable solids, fluids, and thermomechanical effects.
